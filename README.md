# Hello, I'm Priyanjali Patel

## Objective

I am a Ph.D. Astrophysicist turned Data Scientist with a strong background in applied machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and multi-agent systems. My goal is to leverage my expertise in data-driven solutions and AI to solve complex, real-world problems. I am particularly passionate about ethical AI, transparency, and building intelligent systems that make a practical impact.
